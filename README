GraphEval is a project which aims to simplify the task of evaluating data.
It is especially useful if similar tasks should be performed with only slight variations.

This works in three simple steps:

 - First, splitting the whole pipeline into a set of atomic steps, which are called *nodes* (for example "Do a linear regression").

 - Compile the nodes to a graph, essentially plugging their in- and outputs together.

 - Request the result you want from the respective node.
   
The graph takes care of solving the dependencies (i.e. feeding every node with the required data) and eventually loading from and saving to cache.
On top of that, results can also be visualized using the matplotlib wrapper *proplot* by giving every node the knowledge of how to add its results to a figure.

To render the docs, got to the `docs` directory and run `make html`. This will put the html docs into `/docs-build`
